# E-Commerce Page Design

This is a practice project where I recreated a shopping page design using HTML and CSS. The goal was to make it look exactly like the design image.

## 📄 About the Project

I built this layout to practice making websites that look good on both laptops and phones. It has a sidebar on the left, products on the right, and a brand logo section at the bottom.

**What I focused on:**
- Making the layout match the original design.
- Making sure it works on mobile screens (Responsive).
- Writing clean code without using heavy libraries like Bootstrap.

## ✨ Features

- **Mobile Friendly:** The layout changes from side-by-side to a single column on smaller screens.
- **Product Cards:** Includes "New" and "Hot" badges on the images.
- **Hover Effects:** Buttons and links change color when you move your mouse over them.
- **Pure CSS:** I used Flexbox and Grid to arrange everything.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **HTML** (For the structure)
- **CSS** (For the styling and layout)
- **Google Fonts** (To make the text look good)

## 📂 Project Files
